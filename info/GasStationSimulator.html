                    Gas Station Simulator is all about renovating, expanding and
                    running a gas station along a highway in the middle of a
                    desert. Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run
                    your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in
                    this game.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-j">Renovate</p>
                  <p class="text-d">
                    You don't need to stay small. You can expand your gas
                    station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas
                    station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the
                    array of services that you offer to your customers and thus
                    attract more and more varied customers. You have various
                    expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like
                    providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income
                    up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car
                    repairs or even a car wash. There are quite a few choices
                    and most of the expansions can themselves be further
                    expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-j">Expand</p>
                  <p class="text-d">
                    Wield a combination of upgradeable elemental powers and
                    ghost-hunting skills to combat the supernatural threat. Use
                    your ethereal abilities to ascend to the to the top of
                    Tokyo's skyline and soar over the streets to discover new
                    missions or even get the drop on your enemies.

                  <p class="text-d">
                    Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a
                    personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of
                    options to customize what you have already built and lots of
                    decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place.
                    Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired
                    during gameplay. It is not just about making the gas station
                    look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the
                    more customers will be attracted.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-j">Serve</p>
                  <p class="text-d">
                    Serving your customers is key in running your gas station
                    with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up,
                    their shopping done right away and aren't that patient even
                    when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to
                    be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and
                    have to schedule various tasks for when it's less hectic.
                    Proper time management and choosing the right priorities
                    becomes very important when it comes to keeping your
                    customers happy.

                  <p class="text-d">
                    While you can try, it most cases running a gas station that
                    has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different
                    services to your customers might be just too much to handle
                    for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You
                    can hire even multiple employees to help you with the
                    various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own
                    skills and some are better at some tasks than others.
                    Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and
                    become better at them with time.

                  <p class="text-j">Stock</p>
                  <p class="text-d">
                    You can't sell what you don't have. Keeping track of your
                    stock is important and ordering at the right time for the
                    right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low
                    price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it
                    to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your
                    stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really
                    don't want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel.

                    We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep
                    into management features and micromanage the living you know
                    what out of it. However, if micromanaging isn't your cup of
                    tea, we don't force you to deal with the depths of it. That
                    being said, micromanaging some aspects like supplies or
                    employees can be very rewarding both in terms of finances
                    and fun.
